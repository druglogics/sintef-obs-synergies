abstract = {While there is a high interest in drug combinations in cancer therapy, openly accessible datasets for drug combination responses are sparse. Here we present a dataset comprising 171 pairwise combinations of 19 individual drugs targeting signal transduction mechanisms across eight cancer cell lines, where the effect of each drug and drug combination is reported as cell viability assessed by metabolic activity. Drugs are chosen by their capacity to specifically interfere with well-known signal transduction mechanisms. Signalling processes targeted by the drugs include PI3K/AKT, NFkB, JAK/STAT, CTNNB1/TCF, and MAPK pathways. Drug combinations are classified as synergistic based on the Bliss independence synergy metrics. The data identifies combinations that synergistically reduce cancer cell viability and that can be of interest for further pre-clinical investigations.},

abstract = {In a fast evolving field like molecular biology, which produces great amounts of data at an ever increasing pace, it becomes fundamental the development of analysis applications that can keep up with that pace. The Rbbt development framework intends to support the development of complex functionality with strong data processing dependencies, as reusable components, and serving them through a simple and consistent API. This way, the framework promotes reuse and accessibility, and complements other solutions like classic APIs and function libraries or web services. The Rbbt framework currently provides a wide range of functionality from text mining to microarray meta-analysis.},
